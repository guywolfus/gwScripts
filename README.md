## Description:
This module is necessary in order to run any "gw" tools or plugins.  
The package includes the following:

* [Comet Rename Plus+:](https://github.com/guywolfus/gwScripts/blob/main/tools/comet_rename_plus)  
A simple renaming GUI that allows renaming operations such as Prefix, Suffix, Search and Replace, and Rename and Number.  

* [Follow Camera:](https://github.com/guywolfus/gwScripts/blob/main/tools/follow_camera)  
A one-click solution allowing the user a seamless workflow toggling between a fixed camera and a follow-based camera. The toggled camera centers on and follows the selected object in the scene.  

* [Shots Data Manager:](https://github.com/guywolfus/gwScripts/blob/main/tools/shots_data_manager)  
A handy tool for Maya that allows splitting a scene into several other scenes. Mainly envisioned to be used by layout artists on a sequence in order to split it into numbered shots, reducing repetitive shot-prep work and allowing a more camera continuity-friendly workflow.  

## Installation:
Unzip the whole "gwScripts" folder in any selected location on your computer, then drag and drop the `install.mel` file into Maya's viewport.  
Doing so will create a "mod" file in your Maya's settings folder, which will make this package available in all Maya versions.  
If you decide to move the "gwScripts" folder somewhere else, simply use the installation file again and it will overwrite the previous settings.
